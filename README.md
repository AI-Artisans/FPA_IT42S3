# 🚀 Fundamentals of Prescriptive Analysis: The Decision Architect’s Playground 🎯

Welcome, fearless **4th-year IT decision-makers**!
You’ve just entered the official repository for **Fundamentals of Prescriptive Analysis**, where data stops *describing* the world and starts telling it what to do. 📊➡️🧠➡️✅

This repository exists to support your **computer laboratory exercises** by storing **additional resources, datasets, models, and code samples** that will sharpen your skills in optimization, simulation, and decision modeling.

Think of this as your **command center for making data-driven decisions like a pro**.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

This repository is your analytical toolkit, packed with:

* 📊 **Datasets & Supporting Files**
  CSVs, spreadsheets, and sample inputs used in lab problems and demos.

* 🧠 **Reference Implementations**
  Sample scripts, models, and notebooks to help you understand *how* prescriptive solutions are built.

* 💎 **Final Project Resources**
  Templates, guides, and supplementary materials to help you design a solid prescriptive analysis solution.

All of this is organized with a clean, predictable directory structure—because **good decisions start with good organization**.

## 💡 Prerequisites

Before diving into this analytical adventure, make sure you:

* Understand basic **programming concepts**
* Know how to use **Git & GitHub** (clone, commit, push, repeat)
* Have foundational knowledge of:

  * Data analysis
  * Algorithms
  * Mathematical modeling (or at least the courage to face it)

☕ Bonus points if your workstation is fully caffeinated.

## 🎉 Parting Words of Wisdom

* Prescriptive analysis is where **data meets decision power**.
* A wrong model is worse than no model—validate everything.
* Save your work. Commit often. Push responsibly.
* Clean code + clear logic = happy evaluator.
* Most importantly: **enjoy the process of turning data into decisions**.

Good luck, analysts!
Now go forth and **optimize the world—one model at a time** 📈🧠🔥
